# JavaScript coding exercise

1. As per my understanding and keeping page performance in mind, I have developed all code in vanilla Js, because it's not recommended to include any library or framework(React js || Angular || Jquery) for such small project.

2. I can develop the same in any framework given above if required, please give me proper feedback for failure or success.

3. Please arrange a callback from a related person for the understanding of my code.
