# JavaScript coding exercise

1. As per my understanding and keeping page performance in mind, I have developed all code in vanilla Js, because it's not recommended to include any library or framework(React js || Angular || Jquery) for such small project.

2. I have added min files to index.html and the developed files are in the related folders.

3. I can develop the same in any framework given above if required, please give me proper feedback for failure or success.

4. Please arrange a callback from a related person for the understanding of my code.
